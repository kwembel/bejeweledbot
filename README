BEJEWELED BOT


Bejeweledbot is a simple bejeweled game solver, in Ruby/GTK.
The program has been tested succesfully with the following bejeweled games:
- Gweled (Linux game)
- Bejeweled blitz (online game in Flash).

The program is able to:
- take screenshots of the game,
- find the best movement to be played,
- control the mouse to play the movement.

Requirements:
- Ruby
- Gtk
- ruby-gtk2 package
- xte or xdotool (external program used to control the mouse)

How to start the program:
./bejeweledbot.rb -t <table_coordinates> -n <number of jewels per line>
- table coordinates : table top left corner x position, talble top left corner height position, table width, table height.
- number of squares per line : for now the table is supposed to have the same number of jewels per line and per columns.

Example: bejeweledbot.rb -t 580,45,375,375 -n 8

The table coordinates on the screen (in pixels) can be found using the tools xte or xdotool. For example the following 
command waits 3 seconds and display the cursor position on the terminal:
xdotool sleep 3 getmouselocation --shell
